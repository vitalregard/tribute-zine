R E A C H I N G - - - C E R E M O N Y : An Oracle for Knowing

An oracle offering powered by random quotes from Dub: Finding Ceremony by Alexis Pauline Gumbs.

This web tribute seeks to highlight aspects of the work of Alexis Pauline Gumbs and Sylvia Wynter. The atmosphere of black soil, the oceanic, and outer space casts a memory of knowledge held in the cellular history of spirit.

This project was built as a part of my education journey in Seeda School led by Ayana Zaire Cotton.
