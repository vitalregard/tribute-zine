                <p>An oracle offering powered by random quotes from <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Dub/wCjHDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0">Dub: Finding Ceremony</a> by <a href="https://www.alexispauline.com/">Alexis Pauline Gumbs</a>.<p>This web tribute seeks to highlight aspects of the work of Alexis Pauline Gumbs and <a href="https://monoskop.org/Sylvia_Wynter">Sylvia Wynter</a>.

                we would like it if you wrote us poems. we would like it if you wrote us long life sentences. we would like it if you broke sentences and gave us more life than you or we were told could be contained. we would like it if you remained. we would like it if you showed up every day. we would like it if you drank water. we would love it if you would turn off your phone. we would sincerely appreciate it if you stopped pretending to be alone.
